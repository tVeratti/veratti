        <p>Gaming has helped shape me into the person I am today. It has taught me leadership skills, patience, and perserverance. I have gained confidence in myself as a gamer which has transferred well into my professional career.</p>
        <p>I enjoy mostly online competitive games where I can challenge my skills against other players. The satisfaction of improving my abilities and seeing new success at a practiced skill is addictive and wonderful.</p>
