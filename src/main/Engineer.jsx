        <p>
          JavaScript is my sandbox of choice. Sometimes I feel like a master, 
          and other times I am humbled (and excited) by the vast amount of knowledge 
          I still stand to gain.

          My personal GitHub is mostly pet projects that I have used to learn smaller
          pieces of frameworks and patterns. Even this site itself was an experiment with
          technologies that I hope to incorporate into my work and other projects in the 
          future!
