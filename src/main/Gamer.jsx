        <h2>Gamer</h2>
        <p>
          Gaming has helped shape me into the person I am today. It has taught
          me leadership skills, patience, and perserverance. I have gained
          confidence in myself as a gamer which has transferred well into my
          professional career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy mostly online competitive games where I can challenge my
          skills against other players. The satisfaction of improving my
          abilities and seeing new success at a practiced skill is addictive and
          wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have led a worldwide top 10 guild in Rift, ranked up to Master as 
          a DPS main in Overwatch, and earned my fair share of hackusations
          along the way. I am always learning, reflecting, and growing through
          gaming.
